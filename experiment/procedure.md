* This simulation teaches you 4 exceptions one-by-one.
* To select which exception you want to learn, use the dropdown in the leftmost box.
* We have two parts in every experiment - 
    1. Generate an Exception - Learn how a user can generate an exception to avoid how to make those mistakes yourself. You will be entering an input in each of these experiments and your input musst generate the required experiment. If you enter an input that does not generate an exception press `Try Again` to reload the page and reset the animation. Try to make the yellow ball jump to check if you have correctly generated an exception.
    2. Applications of Exception Handling - This section actually teaches you how to write code that handles exceptions and can do all kinds of real world applications safely without generating exceptions. You will have to fill in the blanks in each code snippet and make a program that handles all exceptions that can occur and displays an appropriate message.
